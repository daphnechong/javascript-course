<div class="heading"><p>Code Sydney - Odin Project Javascript Study Group</p></div>

	<p>Here are the list of projects I've built throughout the Code Sydney study group. (Very little CSS effort has gone into these projects. It's all about the javascript.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Week 1</b>
		<br/><a href="week1/index.html">Javascript Calculator</a>
		<br/>Learning javascript events
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Week 2</b>
		<br/><a href="week2/index.html">Restaurant menu</a> 
		<br/>jQuery and the DOM. The challenge was to construct the page entirely using jquery methods.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Week 3</b>
		<br/><a href="week3/index.html">Classic Snake Game</a>
		<br/> Classes, objects and scope. This was a lot of fun to build! I also wrote some tests around the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Week 4</b>
		<br/>(Sadface, I didn't do the homework for this week)
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Week 5</b>
		<br/><a href="week5/index.html">Tic Tac Toe</a>
		<br/>This was actually a simpler challenge than snake.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Week 6</b>
		<br/>break
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Week 7</b>
		<br/><a href="week7/index.html">Minesweeper</a>
	</p>

<div class="heading"><p>Code Sydney - Javascript Study Group</p></div>

	<p>Here are the list of projects I've built throughout the Code Sydney study group. (Very little CSS effort has gone into these projects!)
	</p>
	
	<h3><a href="week1/index.html">Javascript Calculator</a></h3>
	<p>Learning javascript events</p>
	
	<h3><a href="week2/index.html">Restaurant menu</a></h3>
	<p>jQuery and the DOM. The challenge was to construct the page entirely using jquery methods.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="week3/index.html">Classic Snake Game</a></h3>
	<p>Classes, objects and scope. This was a lot of fun to build! I also wrote some tests around the project.</p>
	<h3><a href="week5/index.html">Tic Tac Toe</a></h3>
	<p>This was actually a simpler challenge than snake.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="week7/index.html">Minesweeper</a></h3>
	<p>More work on classes & objects (unfinished)</p>

	<h3><a href="week9/index.html">Missile Command</a></h3>
	<p>Canvas. And a tiny bit of Rx thrown in. This one still has a few bugs, but it is interesting to see how much work needs to go into getting the UI and gameplay right for it to feel 'normal'.</p>
